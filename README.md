# Templates
In this repository, you can find the TASHub presentation templates.

The powerpoint template is in the main directory, while Latex source files and compiled examples can be found in the Latex folder. Useful logos, which are used in the .tex code but may be used for other purposes as well, can be found in the Latex/Logos folder.
